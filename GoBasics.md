1. Why Go?
- code runs fast 
- Garbage collection (it has! usually for language as fast as go, They DON'T!)
- simpler objects (simpler OOD)

2. Compiled code vs inteperated code
- Compiled code is fast
- Interpreters makes coding easier (mange memory automatically(interpreter handles that; compiled language, you need to de-locate those memories) ; infer variable types)

Go is a compile language but has some good things of inteperate language, for example, garbage collection
